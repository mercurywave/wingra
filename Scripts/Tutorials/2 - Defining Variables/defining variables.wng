// variables are declared by using the @ symbol
// you assign values to variables using the : operator
// the expression to the right of the : is assigned to the variable on the left
// code is evaluated in a linear order
// you cannot use a variable which has not been declared

@a : 4
@b : 5
@c : a + b
b : a + 1 // changing b now does not affect the value of c
c : c + 2.2
$IO.Log(c) // outputs 11.2
